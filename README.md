# Backtracking-Algorithm-Visualization

[Backtracking] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) is an Algorithm-technique for solving problem recursively while trying to built solution incremently, one by one and removing thoes solution that fail to satisfy.

[Knight's Tour] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour) and [Rat in the Maze] (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rat-in-a-maze-backtracking-2/) the based on Backtracking algorithm.

## Knight's Tour
A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once.

## Rat in the Maze
A rat starts from source and has to reach the destination. The rat can move only in two directions: forward and down.

## Project Structure

* Source files: `main.py`
* Algorithm files: `Knight_Tour.py`, `Rat_In_The_Maze`
* other files: `ExtraWidgets.py`, `MainMenu.py`, `StartProcess.py`

## Build
